## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Trashify stemmed from a collective desire to address the pressing environmental issues caused by improper waste management. Observing the success of gamified applications like Pok√©mon Go, we realized the potential to harness similar mechanics to incentivize responsible waste disposal practices.

## What it does
Trashify revolutionizes sustainable living by seamlessly connecting users with nearby recycling centers through an intuitive mapping feature. Users earn points by recycling materials at these locations, which can be redeemed for exciting rewards. Additionally, Trashify fosters a sense of community by providing interactive challenges and leaderboards, encouraging friendly competition among users.

## How we built it
Trashify was built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies including geolocation services for mapping, gamification frameworks for point accumulation and rewards, and social networking features for community engagement. The app was developed with a user-centric approach, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for individuals of all backgrounds.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we encountered was sourcing accurate and up-to-date information on recycling centers and their accepted materials. Additionally, balancing the gamification elements to ensure they were engaging without overshadowing the app's primary goal of promoting sustainability required careful consideration and testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have created a platform that not only simplifies the process of responsible waste disposal but also fosters a sense of community and accountability among users. Seeing individuals actively participate in recycling efforts and positively impact their local environments has been incredibly rewarding.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we learned the importance of collaboration and community engagement in driving sustainable initiatives. We also gained insights into the effectiveness of gamification in motivating behavior change and promoting eco-conscious habits.

## What's next for Trashify
Moving forward, we aim to expand Trashify's reach by partnering with municipalities and organizations to increase the availability of recycling centers on the platform. We also plan to enhance the app with educational resources on sustainability and further gamification features to keep users engaged and motivated in their environmental efforts. Additionally, we will continue to iterate based on user feedback to ensure Trashify remains a valuable tool in the fight against waste pollution.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
